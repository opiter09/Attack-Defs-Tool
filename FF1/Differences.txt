This file attempts to document all differences between FF1 and FFC, so that you don't mess things up by
strictly following Documentation.txt.

The biggest difference, of course, is that all the text of FF1 is smooshed together in the file text/japanese.
As a result of this, no text chunking is offered for FF1, because chopping and rebuilding that giant file
would be a *nightmare*. If you don't like that, go code a parser yourself, there's plenty of examples around
here.
