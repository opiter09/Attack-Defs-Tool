This file attempts to document all differences between FF1 and FFC, so that you don't mess things up by
strictly following Documentation.txt.


The biggest difference, of course, is that all the text of FF1 is smooshed together in the file text/japanese.
As a result of this, no text chunking is offered for FF1, because chopping and rebuilding that giant file
would be a *nightmare*. If you don't like that, go code a parser yourself, there's plenty of examples around
here.


For whatever reason, vivosaur chunks have 12 extra bytes of padding at the beginning: two for their ID, then
literally just ten 00's. Thus a vivosaur's element is now at 0x0D. However, that's not all! Right after the
element are two bytes that are, for some unknown reason, equal to that vivosaur's Rank 12 LP divided by 2.
You will want to change these if you go changing a vivosaur's LP amounts. Unfortunately, I cannot just
say to add 14 to all of the offsets, things are just weird enough that I'm better off just listing everything
out:
- 0x0D: Element
- 0x0E-0x0F: Max LP / 2
- 0x20-0x21: Crit Rate (1 reduplicated byte)
