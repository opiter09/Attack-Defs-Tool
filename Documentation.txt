EVERYTHING IS LITTLE-ENDIAN

This is all for FFC only, because FF1's text cannot be cracked and so the order of vivosaurs, moves, etc.
is unknown. Presumably, however, there is a very similar structure.

When I say "chunk," I mean a portion of attack_defs or creature_defs determined by the location of
two adjacent pointers at the beginning of those files.



When it comes to vivosaur chunks, for (almost?) every vivosaur the moves are from 0xBC to 0xC3 for the
normal four (or three), and 0x4E to 0x4F for the Team Skill. The values are the hex versions of that
move's line number in names.text, aka their file's number in moveFiles + 1. All values are two bytes here.

Crit rate is always at 0x12, and reduplicated at 0x13 for some reason. Link chance is at 0x14; both
are out of 100.

A vivosaur's static/blue move is at 0x19. Link is not one of them; you just have Link by having a
non-zero chance. Here's the table for this:
01: nothing
02: ???
03: ???
04: FP Plus
05: Parting Blow
06: Auto LP Recovery
07: Auto Counter
08-0C: Probably intentional gap
0D: Elemental Boost
0E: Position Lock
0F: FP Absorb
10: Solo Power
11: Berserker
12: Enter with Gold Status
13: ??? Enter with Normal Status, maybe?
14: Resurrect

The location of Parting Blow percents, the ID of the status applied, etc. are currently unknown.

A vivosaur's health for each level takes up the last 40 bytes of a chunk. Obviously, each health amount is
thus two bytes each (for Ranks 1 to 20).

For the other stats, the Rank 1 and Rank 20 amounts are just next to each other. 0x04 and 0x05 are Attack,
then 0x08 and 0x09 are Defense, then 0x0C to 0x0D are Accuracy, and then 0x10 and 0x11 are Speed. The
values between are presumably some sort of growth rate indicator.

0xC4 to 0xCB are the levels each move is learned at (two bytes each).

0xA4 to 0xAB tells you what side the vivosaur's support effects apply to. CC 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
means your side, 00 00 00 00 CC 00 00 00 means their side, and all zeroes means the vivosaur has no
support effects. Why CC? The world may never know.

Rank 20 status effects can be found at 0xCC to 0xCF. They go in the usual Attack, Defense, Accuracy,
and Speed order, and each are one byte. For negative effects, the support % equals 255 - number + 1.
Vivosaurs with no support effects at all simply have four less bytes in their chunk, and what is here is
how many moves a vivo has.

On that point: after support effects if they are there is usually 01 02 03 04. This means that a vivosaur
has four non-team skills. For vivosaurs like Cheirus with only three, there is 01 02 03 00 there instead.
To be clear, to make a skill "no skill" in the ID area, use 00 00.

That block mostly seems redundant to me, especially since 0x9C *also* contains the number of moves.
However, it is important for one thing and one thing only: the beginning and ending bytes of this block
are stored at 0xB0 and 0xB8, respectively. You HAVE to change these if you want to add or remove 
support effects entirely, i.e. when you add or delete bytes.

Final word of warning: as with all things, if the file size is different (looking at you, Tonzilla), make
sure to change my locations accordingly. Every value from vanilla should be known, so just look for it.



For moves, the status seems to be in two different places (and notably unrelated to description text).
If its a damage status like Poison, it's the very first two bytes of the chunk; if not, those two bytes
are 01 00, and 0x20-0x21 are used. The first byte is the status, and the second is percent (e.g. 0x64 is
100%).

If a chunk is longer than 0x30, the secondary stuff will be that many bytes later than what is said here.
Hopefully.

If a move is "counter proof," the third byte of its chunk will be 0x00. If not, that byte will be 0x03.

Move FP/damage can (usually) be found at 0x18 to 0x1F. It's also usually reduplicated, so you get two
bytes of FP, then two bytes of damage, then two bytes of FP, and then two bytes of damage. The damage 
is BASE damage, i.e. Wiki Damage - Wiki Attack Stat.

To make a move have --- and deal no damage, literally set the damage values to 0.

Moves with a value attached, like healing, have theirs on the third and fourth bytes after the percent,
as a two-byter. If there is no value, it's just 00 00 there. The two-byter in between seems to specify
what it is for, e.g. 01 00 for healing, or 07 00 for...everything else? Still not clear on this one.

And now for the status tables:

PRIMARY (first two bytes):
01: nothing
02: Normal Poison
03: Gold Poison
04: Venom (U-Raptor)
05: Normal Sleep
06: Gold Sleep
07: Normal Scare
08: Gold Scare
09: Normal Enrage
0A: Gold Enrage
0B: Normal Confusion
0C: Gold Confusion
0D: Normal Excite
0E: Gold Excite
0F: Counter (Percent is listed as 100, 70% chance is hardcoded)
10: Super Counter (Percent is listed as 100, 100% chance is hardcoded)
11: Enflame
12: Super Enflame
13: Harden
14: Super Harden
15: Quicken
16: Super Quicken
17: Charge
18: Super Charge (unused)

SECONDARY (0x20-0x21):
01: nothing
02: Transformation (bytes after percent are 07 00, extra value is always 01 00, vivosaur IDs start
at 0x30 and are each one byte. Once again ID = vivoFiles file number + 1. Also 0x28 is the number of
possible vivos to transform into)
03: All-zone attack (always 0%, bytes after percent are 07 00, no extra value. Can hit your team if
used with a support effect like Harden, and can actually deal damage unlike with single-targeting.)
04: Steal LP Equal to Damage (bytes after percent are 07 00, no extra value)
05: Steal FP (bytes after percent are 07 00, extra value is stealing amount)
06: Spite Blast (bytes after pecent are 07 00, extra value is damage amount)
07: Power Scale [equalize FP] (bytes after percent are 07 00, no extra value)
08: Rotate (bytes after percent are 07 00, no extra value)
09: ???
0A: Heal whole team (bytes after pecent are 05 00, extra value is healing amount)
0B: Sacrifice [nearly kill self to heal allies] (bytes after percent are 07 00, no extra value)
0C: Law of the Jungle [nearly kill ally and gain health] (bytes after percent are 07 00, no extra value)
0D: Healing (bytes after percent are 01 00, extra value is healing amount)
0E: ???
0F: Cure all statuses (bytes after percent are 07 00, no extra value)
10: ???
11: Randomly attack enemy team (bytes after percent are 07 00, no extra value)
12: Infection (bytes after percent are 07 00, extra value is 04 00, and since the wiki says it's
five turns to death I wager this controls that)
13: Heal and cure statuses (bytes after percent are 01 00, extra value is healing amount)
14: Heal and cure statuses for whole team (bytes after percent are 05 00, extra value is healing amount)
15: Fickle Goddess [boost a stat randomly] (bytes after percent are 07 00, no extra value)
16: Inflict effects randomly (bytes after percent are 07 00, no extra value)
17: Instant KO (bytes after percent are 07 00, extra value is chance out of 255)
18: Cure all statuses for the whole team (bytes after percent are 07 00, no extra value)
